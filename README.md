# Background-Timer
Background Timer is a timer app. 
After pressing the start button, the countdown starts using the scheduled Time r function. 
If the user collapses the application without pressing the stop button, the timer, saving the current time value in UserDefaults, after restoring the application will calculate the difference in the time interval, update the label and continue counting.
